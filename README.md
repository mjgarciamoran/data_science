A repository to store my Python Data Science projects.

## Data Fetching
My interest in high frequency time-series data and its lack of availability on the internet inspired me to learn data-fetching tools, which I have applied in the following projects:
- [K-Pop Release Database with Daily Analytics - 07/2025](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/kpop_release_database)
- [Hearthstone Battlegrounds Leaderboard Database - 08/2025](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/hearthstone_bgs_db_S11)

These are improved versions of the projects, now running on virtual machines that automate the process and fetch data at high frequencies (K-pop: daily, Hearthstone: every 6 minutes).
