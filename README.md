# Data Science
A repository to store my __Python-based Data Science projects__, including both data-fetching automation and data analysis work.

## Data Fetching
My interest in __high frequency time-series data__ and the limited availability of such datasets on the internet inspired me to learn data-fetching tools, which I have applied in the following projects:
- [K-Pop Release Database with Daily Analytics](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/kpop_release_database) - 07/2025
- [Hearthstone Battlegrounds Leaderboard Database S11](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/hearthstone_bgs_db_S11) - 08/2025 - Currently not working
- [Hearthstone Battlegrounds Leaderboard Database S12](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/hearthstone_bgs_db_S12) - 12/2025

These are improved versions of the projects, now running on virtual machines that automate the process and fetch data at high frequencies:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▸ K-Pop → once a day  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▸ Hearthstone → once every 6 minutes

## Data Analysis
The analysis phase combines __Python__ (for preprocessing and statistical visualization using libraries such as _matplotlib_ and _pandas_) with __Power BI__.
