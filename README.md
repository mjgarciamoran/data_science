# Data Science
A repository to store my Python Data Science projects.

## Data Fetching
My interest in high frequency time-series data and the limited availability of such datasets on the internet inspired me to learn data-fetching tools, which I have applied in the following projects:
- [K-Pop Release Database with Daily Analytics](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/kpop_release_database) - 07/2025
- [Hearthstone Battlegrounds Leaderboard Database](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/hearthstone_bgs_db_S11) - 08/2025

These are improved versions of the projects, now running on virtual machines that automate the process and fetch data at high frequencies:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▸ K-pop → once a day  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▸ Hearthstone → once every 6 minutes
