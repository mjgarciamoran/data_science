# Data Science
A repository to store my Python Data Science projects.

## Data Fetching
My interest in high frequency time-series data and its lack of availability on the internet inspired me to learn data fetching tools, which I have used in the following projects:
- [KPOP](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/kpop_release_database)
- [HS]
These are upgrades of my 2024 projects
## Data Analysis
- [Hearthstone Battlegrounds MMR Analysis - Season 8](https://github.com/mjgarciamoran/hearthstone_mmr_S8)
